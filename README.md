# Image Generation using Stable Diffusion

## Objective
To generate images from text prompts using a pre-trained diffusion model.

## Model Used
Stable Diffusion v1.5 (runwayml)

## How It Works
Stable Diffusion is a generative diffusion model that starts with random noise and iteratively removes noise to produce an image based on a text prompt.

## Tools
- Python
- HuggingFace Diffusers
- Google Colab (GPU enabled)

## Prompt Examples
- A futuristic floating city above the clouds at golden hour, ultra realistic, cinematic lighting.
- A dreamy Korean countryside with cherry blossoms, soft pastel sky.

## Result
Successfully generated high-quality AI images using GPU acceleration.
